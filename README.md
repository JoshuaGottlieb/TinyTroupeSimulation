## Deliverable 1 Content

Content for deliverable 1 is available under [src/deliverable-01](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/TinyTroupeSimulation/tree/main/src/deliverable-01). Included are screenshots showing the installation of the [TinyTroupe package](https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe), as well as the creation of multiply TinyPersons, user-agent interactions via the listen_and_act() method, and agent-agent interactions using a TinyWorld. The usage of the TinyTroupe package is also viewable in a Jupyter notebook.

## Deliverable 2 Content

Content for deliverable 2 is available under [src/deliverable-02](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/TinyTroupeSimulation/tree/main/src/deliverable-02). Included is the code for a Streamlit application and helper funcitons. The model is deployed on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/joshua-gottlieb/Dual-Agent-Interview-Simulation). The code uses the [Duel Agent Simulation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eagle0504/duel-agent-simulation) by Yiqiao Yin as a base but has modified it to simulate a technical interview where the interviewer asks a progamming question and the interviewee must respond by explaining their thought process and writing sample code.
