## Deliverable 1 Content

Content for deliverable 1 is available under [src/deliverable-01](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/TinyTroupeSimulation/tree/main/src/deliverable-01). Included are screenshots showing the installation of the [TinyTroupe package](https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe), as well as the creation of multiply TinyPersons, user-agent interactions via the listen_and_act() method, and agent-agent interactions using a TinyWorld. The usage of the TinyTroupe package is also viewable in a Jupyter notebook.

## Deliverable 2 Content

Content for deliverable 2 is available under [src/deliverable-02](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/TinyTroupeSimulation/tree/main/src/deliverable-02). Included is the code for a Streamlit application and helper funcitons. The model is deployed on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/joshua-gottlieb/Dual-Agent-Interview-Simulation). The code uses the [Duel Agent Simulation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eagle0504/duel-agent-simulation) by Yiqiao Yin as a base but has modified it to simulate a technical interview where the interviewer asks a progamming question and the interviewee must respond by explaining their thought process and writing sample code. At the end of the simulation, the user is prompted to provide a file name and can download all of the final code functions that were generated during the simulation.

## Deliverable 3 Content

Content for deliverable 3 is available under [src/deliverable-03](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/TinyTroupeSimulation/tree/main/src/deliverable-03). This deliverable features ModelBot, an agentic helper designed to assist non-technical users with performing regression or classification on csv data. Currently, the ModelBot can be run through Jupyter Notebook, with instructions for setting up the FastAPI backend listed in the directory README. Test data is provided for testing ModelBot's functionality, as well as sample reports for classification and regression tasks generated by the agent. There is also a System Design presentation which details the overarching design of ModelBot and the intended user journies.
