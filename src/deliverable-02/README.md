# Deliverable 2

The application is available publicly at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/joshua-gottlieb/Dual-Agent-Interview-Simulation

The application has been enhanced from the base form covered in class at [Duel Agent Simulation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eagle0504/duel-agent-simulation). Rather than have two agents only partake in a verbal interview, the simulation now covers the concept of a technical interview where the interviewee is required to generate Python code. The code and response are then reviewed by a judge and revised as needed. At the end of the simulation, all of the Python scripts are wrapped together into a single file for the user to download.
